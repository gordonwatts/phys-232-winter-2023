    "# Lab HW #1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will build a binary timer using the neopixels on your bluefruit: it will count off the seconds, in binary, using the neopixels to display the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some introductory reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are binary numbers? They are just numbers that count up base-2, similar to our normal system, which is base-10. A [reasonable introduction can be found here](https://engineersphere.com/how-to-count-in-binary) if you are unfamiliar.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop some of the basic code here in this notebook, and then move it over to the bluefruit. Debugging is a little bit easier in a notebook as compared to the bluefruit itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick note on debugging. You can put `help(str)` in your `code.py` file, open the serial bridge, and then save the `code.py` file on your bluefruit. You'll see a very different set of methods, etc., come back than you see if you execute `help(str)` here. This technique helped me a lot when writing this lab and I was trying to understand which methods are supported and which ones are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the design of this code in several blocks. Simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increment a counter by one each second\n",
    "1. Turn the value of the counter into a binary number\n",
    "1. Use the binary number to drive the neopixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make heavy use of functions, etc. to build this in a nice composable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second thing to think about is how we will put this in files. Lets do it in two files. THe first file will be `binary_helpers.py` - we can put the binary converter and the display methods in there. The counter function and main loop we'll put in a file called `binary_clock.py`."
